Dead basic utility for dumping the file prologue of Password Safe
version 3 files. Really just an excuse to try out the Bitstring
module in [Ocaml].

## Build Setup

The [Oasis][Oasis] build tool is used. Consult the Oasis documentation for how
to generate build files.

This application depends on the following packages:

 - Core
 - Bitstring
